## Memory Challenge Game

This project is a dynamic and challenging "Memory Challenge Game" developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game interface presents four distinct colors, requiring players to memorize and replicate the sequence of colors clicked in each round. The game mechanics involve remembering and accurately replicating the sequence; any deviation results in the termination of the game.

### Features

- **Color Sequence:** The game presents four distinct colors in each round, challenging players to memorize the sequence.
  
- **User Interaction:** Players interact with the game by clicking on the colors in the sequence they remember.

- **Accuracy Tracking:** The game tracks the accuracy of the player's sequence replication and terminates the game if any deviation occurs.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Used for structuring the game interface.
  
- **CSS:** Used for styling and layout design.
