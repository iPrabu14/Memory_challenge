Developed a dynamic and challenging ”Memory Challenge Game” using HTML,CSS, and 
JavaScript. The game interface presents four distinct colors, requiring players to 
memorize and replicate the sequence of colors clicked in each round. The game 
mechanics involve remembering and replicating the sequence accurately; any deviation 
results in the termination of the game
